# Parallel-Algorithms-to-Search-over-Large-Genomic-Sequences
Large sets of data are generated through genomic analysis and it is a cumbersome task to process such large amounts of data. This repo defines an efficient parallel algorithm using OpenMP that searches for specific sequences parallely over large data spaces thus reducing the total time taken.
